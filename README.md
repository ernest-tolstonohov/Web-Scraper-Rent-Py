# [WEB SCRAPER](https://github.com/ernest-tolstonohov/Web-Scraper-Rent-Py)
This code performs the functions of collective information from the site: https://www.openrent.co.uk/

Then you can use this information for Chatbots or other ways to display information.

You can customize the search according to the criteria you need by replacing values in the dictionary.

This code is written using the BeautifulSoup library and Selenium (in my case, I used the undetected-chromedriver library)
